Hi, im a chemistry master student  

I'm doing my third rotation at [Dr. Elena Meirzadeh lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/MCMS/meirzadeh/)  
In this lab we use innovative solid state synthesis methods to create new nanomaterials.

I have a bachelor's degree in chemistry from the Shulich Faculty of Chemistry at the Technion. 

I love my cat Chernesh, and I enjoy playing the [trombone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trombone)
